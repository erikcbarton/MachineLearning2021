This is a machine learning library developed by Erik Barton for
CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

To run one of the libraries simply go to the folder and run the run file with ./run.sh. See the run.sh files for how to change what sections of the assignment are run.

NOTE: The GradientDescent solution was originally allocated in the EnsembleLearning folder. It has been left there for grading ease. It has also been duplicated in its own LinearRegression
folder.
