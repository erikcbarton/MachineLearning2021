This is a machine learning library developed by Erik Barton for
CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

To run one of the libraries simply go to the folder and run the run file with ./run.sh. See the run.sh files for how to change what sections of the assignment are run.

NOTE: The GradientDescent solution was originally allocated in the EnsembleLearning folder. It has been left there for grading ease. It has also been duplicated in its own LinearRegression
folder.

NOTE: The output of my projets are always print statements. I prefer to make the plots in excel after moving the raw data.

NOTE: As per request, I am adding additional runHW#.sh files to this parent folder for ease of grading. I will continue to also place 
run.sh files in the actual folders as well.
